# SearchEverywhere-ts
Are you at all familiar with Jetbrains products? Visual Studio Code? They have a revolutionary feature called "Search Everywhere", that allows you to hit some key combination, and jump to literally anywhere within the product.

SearchEverywhere-ts is a similar Google Chrome extension that allows you to jump to any open tab, bookmark, etc. all with one key combination.

# What's Here?
This project contains the transpiled Javascript (transpiled from Typescript) that lets the extension work. It contains multiple unreachable code paths to use different search algorithms, like substring searching, fuzzy searching, etc.
